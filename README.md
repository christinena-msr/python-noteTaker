# python-noteTaker

## Overview
Welcome to my first deployed python backend application using Django.
This is my first attempt to learn and utilize Python3 for backend development. 

If you're interested in learning as well this resource has been a great tutorial: [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)

The application itself will be utilizing a complete Javascript frontend application from another project.
